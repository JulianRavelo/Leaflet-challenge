# Leaflet-challenge
## Scope
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, provides scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world daily, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, I have been tasked with developing a way to visualise USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.
## Results
By using information from USGS website, a mapping tool was created to visualize earthquakes around the world in the last month. To develop this tool, I used the Javascript libraries D3 and Leaflet.  
The size of the circle indicates the magnitude and its colour, the depth of the earthquake.  
I've included some screenshots of the final tool below.
